**A computational study of political districting strategies and their impact on electoral fairness**  

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `districting_methods.py`  
Core module implementing electoral districting algorithms:
- **Fair districting** ‚Äì Maximizing proportional representation and/or compactness
- **Partisan gerrymandering** ‚Äì Simulating biased district configurations

### `/gerrymandering_visualisation`  
Django web application for interactive analysis of the case study
- **District mapping**
- **Comparative scenarios**:
  - Fair vs. gerrymandered configurations
  - Fragmented vs. united opposition strategies (Poland 2023 parlimentary elections)

### To turn on the server - run `run.bat` file

### `run.ipynb`  
Jupyter notebook for executing districting algorithms with customizable parameters

### `show_results.ipynb`
Jupyter notebook for visualizing and analyzing results from districting algorithms
